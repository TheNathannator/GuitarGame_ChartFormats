# Legacy Content

Since .chart is an old format, there is of course content considered to be legacy. These were either never implemented in anything (at least as far as anyone knows), or are no longer relevant to modern programs/games.

## Section Names

Some older charts have a `SingleBass` track present, which was used for GH3/GHTCP. This is just another 5-fret guitar track, the semantics of which are not fully clear yet; however, most everything nowadays doesn't support it.

The following tracks are present in Feedback Editor, but they were never actually fleshed out and simply use the regular 5-fret guitar layout.

- `EnhancedGuitar`
- `CoopLead`
- `CoopBass`
- `10KeyGuitar`
- `DoubleDrums`
- `Vocals`

## Battle Mode Special Phrases

These special phrases are used by GHTCP to mark phrases used in battles. They don't appear to have ever been used in any charts, or even publically documented, but it's possible that GHTCP might be able to export the original GH3 boss battle charts using these phrases.

| Special Type | Description              |
| :----------: | :----------              |
| 3            | Battle Star Power phrase |
| 4            | Battle player 1 phrase   |
| 5            | Battle player 2 phrase   |
