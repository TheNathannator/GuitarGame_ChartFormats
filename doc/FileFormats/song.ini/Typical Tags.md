# Typical song.ini Tags

The tags listed here are all the common and recommended tags that should be supported by most consumers of the format. While there are many tags in existence, very few are commonly used or needed in order for things to work correctly.

Some tags are specific to certain game modes, and do not need to be supported if the game mode is not supported.

### Not Recommended

These tags are not recommended to be used in new charts, as either there are better alternatives, or they can affect how the chart plays without affecting the hash of the chart file itself (ideally these would instead be set using events or properties in the chart file, but so far no one's implemented or standardized anything for that).
