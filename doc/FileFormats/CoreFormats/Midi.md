# MIDI

A MIDI file is a file that stores a MIDI stream. It is a binary format and uses the `.mid` and `.midi` file extensions (`.midi` is not typically used for charts, however).

Modern .mid charts follow a format originating from Rock Band's .mid chart format, with some additional functionality added in by Phase Shift and Clone Hero. Older .mid charts are slightly different and are based on Guitar Hero 1/2's format, but follow similar patterns.

This document will be split up later into multiple documents, with one being a reference standard that only includes what matters for modern-day usage, and the others being more game-centric.

## Basic Infrastructure

This section doesn't provide full technical details, but should give enough for a general idea of what's going on in a MIDI file.

__This section should not be used to build a MIDI parser from scratch, there are other references for MIDI that should be used instead, such as the MIDI Association's specifications linked in the [References section](#references).__

### Number Conventions

For the most part, numbers are stored in big-endian format.

Some numbers have a variable length, from 1 to 4 bytes. These numbers are stored with the first 7 bits (starting from the least significant bit) per byte storing the actual value, and the most significant bit of each byte set if it is not the last byte of the stored number (in other words, it is a flag indicating that there is another byte). This makes the largest possible number (after decoding) `0x0FFFFFFF`.

Variable-length number examples from the Standard MIDI File Specifications:

| Number       | Stored Bytes    |
| :-----       | :-----------    |
| `0x00000000` | `0x00`          |
| `0x00000040` | `0x40`          |
| `0x0000007F` | `0x7F`          |
| `0x00000080` | `0x81 00`       |
| `0x00002000` | `0xC0 00`       |
| `0x00003FFF` | `0xFF 7F`       |
| `0x00004000` | `0x80 80 00`    |
| `0x00100000` | `0xC0 80 00`    |
| `0x001FFFFF` | `0xFF FF 7F`    |
| `0x00200000` | `0x81 80 80 00` |
| `0x08000000` | `0xC0 80 80 00` |
| `0x0FFFFFFF` | `0xFF FF FF 7F` |

### Chunks

MIDI files are comprised of what are called "chunks". These chunks are distinct portions of data within the file, and are marked using the following format:

`<Type> <Length>`

- `Type` is a 4-character ASCII string indicating the chunk type.
- `Length` is the byte length of the chunk represented as a 32-bit big-endian number.

There are two types of chunks:

- Header chunks
- Track chunks

#### Header Chunks

Header chunks contain metadata about the MIDI file as a whole. Their format is as follows:

`"MThd" 06 <MIDI type> <Number of tracks> <Delta-time type/resolution>`

- Header chunks use the `MThd` type string.
- Header chunks are a static 6 bytes long.
- `MIDI type` is a 16-bit number indicating the type of MIDI file:
  - 0 - The file contains a single track.
  - 1 - The file contains one or more simultaneous tracks.
  - 2 - The file contains one or more sequential single-track patterns. These are not used in chart files.
- `Number of tracks` is a 16-bit number representing the number of tracks in the file. As this is only metadata, the actual number of tracks may be different than specified here.
- `Delta-time type/resolution` is a 16-bit number representing both what unit the resolution is measured in, and how many ticks the unit is divided in to. This is not used in chart files.
  - The most-significant bit (bit 15) is a boolean indicating the format:
    - `0` - Resolution is in ticks per quarter note.
      - The other 15 bits represent the resolution number.
    - `1` - Resolution is in ticks per SMPTE frame.
      - Bits 0-7 represent the resolution number.
      - Bits 8-14 represent the SMPTE number of the format to be used, with its sign flipped and stored as a negative two's compliment value. The value should correspond to the 4 standard SMPTE and MIDI time code formats:
        - `-24` - 24 frames per second
        - `-25` - 25 frames per second
        - `-29` - 29.97 frames per second (drop-frame)
        - `-30` - 30 frames per second

#### Track Chunks

Track chunks contain the actual MIDI data streams. Their format is as follows:

`"MTrk" <Length> <Event[]>`

- Track chunks use the `MTrk` type string.
- Track chunks do not have a static length.
- `Event[]` is one or more MIDI event.

In a format 1 file, the first track should be used exclusively for tempo, time signature, and SMPTE offset data.

### Events

MIDI events follow this general format:

`<Delta-time> <Status> <Data[]>`

- `Delta-time` is the time in ticks relative to either the start of the track, or to the previous event in the stream.
- `Status` is a byte indicating the event type.
  - MIDI files use running status, meaning that channel events can omit the status byte and re-use the status of a previous channel event. The first event must specify a status.
- `Data[]` is any number of bytes representing the data of the event.

#### Event Bytes

The byte values in events are split evenly into two categories: data bytes (`0x00`-`0x7F`), and status bytes (`0x80`-`0xFF`). Status bytes indicate the type of event, and data bytes contain the event's data.

Some System Exclusive events may contain data bytes higher than `0x7F`

The specific formats of events is beyond the scope of this guide, so they are not covered here.

### Event Types

Not all of these event types pertain to chart files, but they're listed anyways as a general overview.

#### Channel Voice

Channel voice events control a channel's voices. The bottom 4 bits of channel voice messages represent a 4-bit channel number, giving 16 channels per track (numbered 0-15 throughout this document). In the following table, this will be notated as `n` in the Byte column.

| Format                 | Name                    | Description |
| :-----                 | :---                    | :---------- |
| `8n <num> <vel>`       | Note On                 | Marks the start of a note.<br>`num` is a 7-bit note number from 0-127, `vel` is a 7-bit velocity value from 0-127.<br>A Note On with a velocity of 0 is equivalent to a Note Off. |
| `9n <num> <vel>`       | Note Off                | Marks the end of a note.<br>`num` is a 7-bit note number from 0-127, `vel` is a 7-bit velocity value from 0-127. |
| `An <num> <aft>`       | Polyphonic Key Pressure | An aftertouch value that modifies a note in some way.<br>`num` is a 7-bit note number from 0-127, `aft` is a 7-bit aftertouch value from 0-127. |
| `Bn <num> <val>`       | Control Change          | Changes the value of a control channel.<br>`num` is a 7-bit controller number from 0-127, and `val` is a 7-bit control value (0-127).<br>Controller numbers 120-127 are reserved for channel mode events, detailed later. |
| `Cn <prgm>`            | Program Change          | Changes the selected program (sound, voice, preset, etc.) of a channel.<br>`prgm` is a 7-bit program number from 0-127. |
| `Dn <aft>`             | Channel Pressure        | An aftertouch value that modifies a whole channel in some way.<br>`aft` is a 7-bit aftertouch value from 0-127. |
| `En <num> <bls> <bms>` | Pitch Bend              | Bends the pitch of a note.<br>`num` is a 7-bit note number, `bls` and `bms` are a 14-bit bend value from 0-16383, where `bls` are the least significant bits, and `bms` are the most significant bits.<br>Max negative is (LSB, MSB) 0, 0; center is 0, 64 (8,192); max positive is 127, 127 (16,383). |

#### Channel Mode

Channel mode events control parameters that affect a channel's response to voice events. These are special control change controllers, using the reserved 120-127 control channels. They are also encoded with a 4-bit channel number (0-15), but can only be sent and received on an instrument's main channel (referred to as its "Basic Channel").

`Bn <120-127> <val>`

| Format         | Name                  | Description                                                                             |
| :-----         | :---                  | :----------                                                                             |
| `Bn 120 0`     | All Sound Off         | Disables all notes and sets their volumes to zero.                                      |
| `Bn 121 <val>` | Reset All Controllers | Resets all control channels to their default state.<br>`val` should only be 0 unless otherwise allowed in a specific recommended practice. |
| `Bn 122 <val>` | Local Control         | Enables or disables a device's local controls.<br>`val` acts as a max/min boolean: enables with `FF`, disables with `00`. |
| `Bn 123 0`     | All Notes Off         | Turns off all currently active notes.                                                   |
| `Bn 124 0`     | Omni Off              | Sets a device to only respond to events on its basic channel. Also turns off all notes. |
| `Bn 125 0`     | Omni On               | Sets a device to respond to events on all channels. Also turns off all notes.           |
| `Bn 126 <val>` | Mono On (Poly Off)    | Sets a device to respond monophonically to notes on a channel. Also turns off all notes.<br>`val` is either 0 if Omni is on, or the number of channels to be allowed starting from the basic channel if Omni is off. |
| `Bn 127 0`     | Poly On (Mono Off)    | Sets a device to respond polyphonically to notes on all channels. mode. Also turns off all notes. |

#### System Events

System events affect the whole MIDI stream and are not specific to a channel (i.e. they are received on all channels). There are three types of system events: Common, Real-Time, and Exclusive.

System events, with the exception of System Exclusive events, are not supported in MIDI files, but may be escaped through a special form of Exclusive events, for purposes such as transmission to a physical MIDI device.

#### System Common Events

Common events are used for non-real-time messages such as synchronization before playback, specifying a song to be played, and requesting tuning of an analog synth. Except for the End of Exclusive even (covered in the [SysEx section](#system-exclusive-events)), these are not supported in MIDI files, so they will not be covered here. (End of Exclusive is .)

#### System Real-Time Events

Real-Time events are used for real-time synchronization and playback. These are also not supported in MIDI files, so they will not be covered here.                           |

#### System Exclusive Events

System Exclusive (often shortened as SysEx) events are flexible, and aside from the starting and ending bytes, and a manufacturer/device ID, their format is vendor-defined. They can contain any number of data bytes, and they are the only System events allowed in MIDI files.

| Format                 | Event Name          | Description                                    |
| :----:                 | :---------          | :----------                                    |
| `F0 <len> <byte[]> F7` | Standard SysEx      | Sends a SysEx event.<br>`F0` starts a SysEx event, `F7` ends a SysEx event. `len` is the number of bytes in the event including the `F7`, `byte[]` is one or more bytes.<br>The first 1 or 3 bytes are typically a numeric ID. If the first byte is 0, the next two are the ID, otherwise just the first is. |
| `F7 <len> <byte[]>`    | SysEx (No end byte) | Sends a SysEx event without using an ending byte.

There are some Universal SysEx events defined in the MIDI Association's documentation, but for simplicity's sake these will not be documented here.

##### Warning For SysEx

Standard SysEx events normally do not allow data byte values above `0x7F`, however some SysEx events used in charts violate this, so this must be accounted for in MIDI parsing.

#### Meta Events

Meta events are events that store non-MIDI data such as text. They follow this format:

`FF <type> <length> <data[]>`

- `type` is a 1-byte type code of the meta event.
- `length` is a variable-length number representing the byte length of `data[]`.
- `data[]` is any number of data bytes contained in the event.

| Format                                  | Event Name          | Description |
| :----:                                  | :---------          | :---------- |

| `FF 04 <len> <text[]>`                  | Instrument name     | A description of the instrumentation for the track.                    |
| `FF 05 <len> <text[]>`                  | Lyric               | A lyric, typically a single syllable.                                  |

##### Type 1 MIDI Tempo Map Track

Typically, a type 1 MIDI file dedicates its first track to tempo map data and other things that affect all tracks, with the rest of the tracks being normal tracks.

## Implementation Details

The following sections detail per-track tables and lists of MIDI notes, text events, and SysEx events that lay out charts.

Please note that these should not be used as a comprehensive technical documentation for how charts should be made for Rock Band or Guitar Hero 1/2, this document is focused on the format itself and does not include most game-specific events, limitations, or technicalities. Other documents are included in this repo for that purpose.

There may also be some things missing here and there, but the core functionality for each track should be fully documented. Given the nature of .mid files being able to contain tracks and events far beyond the ones listed, unexpected tracks, notes, and other events should be ignored.

### Track Names

Tracks are identified by their track name meta event.

Some of the tracks listed here are not documented in this particular document, rather they are game-specific and documented in that game's .mid document.

Standard tracks:

| Track Name                           | Track Description            |

### Basic Info

Each track consists of various MIDI notes that serve some purpose, along with text events and possibly SysEx events. This section defines some nomenclature common in each section, and some specifics on how some things work.

- Markers refer to a note that marks either a phrase or a modification to a note.
  - Phrase markers typically do not include notes on the same tick as their Note Off, meaning that if a Star Power phrase ends on tick 4800, it will not affect notes that start on tick 4800.
  - Note markers typically will affect all notes under their range, not just ones that start at the same time or match their length. They also typically do not include the Note Off in their affected range.

### Metadata

Metadata for .mid charts is not stored within the .mid file itself; rather, it is contained in an accompanying song.ini file, documented in [Song_ini.md](Song_ini.md).

### SysEx Event Details

SysEx events are used in some chart files to specify modifications to notes. These originate from Phase Shift, and follow this format:

`50 53 00 <message> <difficulty> <type> <value>`

- `50 53 00` is an identifier. `50 53` is the hexadecimal ASCII representation of the letters `PS`.
- `message` is the message type. Currently, there is only one message type.
  - `00` - Phrase
- `difficulty` is the difficulty this event affects as a hexadecimal number.

| `FF`  | All difficulties<br>This value violates standard SysEx specs. |

- `type` is the modification type code.

| `11`  | Real Drums yellow cymbal+tom    |
| `12`  | Real Drums blue cymbal+tom      |
| `13`  | Real Drums green cymbal+tom     |

- `value` is the value for this event.
  - For phrase messages, this is either `00` to end the phrase, or `01` to enable the phrase.

### 5-Fret Tracks

- `T1 GEMS` - GH1 Lead Guitar
- `PART GUITAR` - Lead Guitar
- `PART GUITAR COOP` - Co-op Guitar
- `PART BASS` - Bass Guitar
- `PART RHYTHM` - Rhythm Guitar
- `PART KEYS` - 5-Lane Keys
  - 5-lane keys gets its own sub-section later because while it could be treated as just another 5-fret track to allows things like forcing, RB3 probably does not expect/allow forcing and the like.

Additional information:

- Notes get forced as HOPOs (hammer-ons/pull-offs) automatically if they are close enough to the previous note, unless they are the same lane as the previous note, or are a chord.
  - In .mid, the default threshold is a 1/12th step (though sources elsewhere say the threshold is, assuming a 480 tick resolution, a 1/16th (120 ticks) step or 170 ticks instead of 160, but the currently accepted threshold is a 1/12th step (160 ticks)). This can be changed through the song.ini tag `hopo_frequency`.
  - Notes can be forced as either strums or HOPOs using the Force Strum and Force HOPO markers. Both single notes and chords can be forced, and it is possible to create same-fret consecutive HOPOs (both single and chord) through forcing.
- In .mid, sustains shorter than a 1/12th step should be cut off and turned into a normal note. This can be changed using the `sustain_cutoff_threshold` song.ini tag. This allows charters using a DAW to not have to make their notes 1 tick long in order for it to not be a sustain.
- Trill and tremolo lanes are used to make imprecise/indiscernible trills or fast strumming easier to play. They prevent overstrumming and only require you to hit faster than a certain threshold to hit the charted notes.
- As a note: Some older .mid charts contain notes that are almost on the same position, but not quite. Guitar Hero 1/2 and Rock Band have a mechanism to snap notes with a position difference of 10 ticks or less (regardless of resolution) together as a chord, with the position to snap to being the start position of the earliest note within the chord. __This is only noted here in the core document as a note/warning, doing this snapping is not particularly recommended for games since it'll rarely be an issue and sloppy charting should not be encouraged.__

Additional info:

- 4-Lane:
  - Notes are cymbals by default in .mid. Toms are marked using notes 110-112, excluding red which is always a tom note.
    - This makes it impossible to have a tom and cymbal of the same color at the same position, unless the respective tom+cymbal SysEx event is enabled.
  - Roll lanes are used to make imprecise/indiscernible fast rhythms such as drum rolls or cymbal swells easier to play. They prevent overhitting and only require you to hit faster than a certain threshold to hit the charted notes.
    - During parsing, if a 1-lane roll starts on a chord (excluding kicks), the lane should be marked on the lane matching the next non-chord note.
    - Roll lanes cannot be applied to kicks.
- 5-lane:
  - Red, blue, and green are toms, yellow and orange are cymbals.
  - Drum sustains are used for imprecise/indiscernible fast rhythms such as drum rolls or cymbal swells. They prevent overhitting and require you to hit faster than a certain threshold (around 4 hits per second in GH) to maintain the sustain.
  - Unlike 4-lane roll lanes, kicks can be drum sustains.
- Expert+ kicks are used for double-kick sections or kicks faster than around 5-6 kicks per second, alternating these faster kicks between normal and Expert+ to make these sections playable with a single pedal.
  - In gameplay, they are equivalent to normal kicks, but they should only be visible if the user enables them.
- Accent and ghost notes are notes that need to be hit either hard or soft, respectively.
  - A note marked at a velocity of 127 is an accent note, and a note at a velocity of 1 is a ghost note.
  - Clone Hero requires an `[ENABLE_CHART_DYNAMICS]`/`ENABLE_CHART_DYNAMICS` text event to be present to enable ghosts/accents, in order to preserve compatibility with charts that weren't charted with velocity in mind. Using this approach is recommended.

| `[ENABLE_CHART_DYNAMICS]` | Enables accent/ghost marking.<br>Can be found both with and without brackets. |

Mix events:

`[mix <difficulty> drums<configuration><flag>]` - Sets a stem configuration for drums. This event can be found both with or without brackets, and with either spaces or underscores.

- `difficulty` is a number indicating the difficulty this event applies to:

| Text | Description |
| :--: | :---------- |
| `0`  | Easy        |
| `1`  | Medium      |
| `2`  | Hard        |
| `3`  | Expert      |

- `configuration` is a number corresponding to a specific stem configuration:

| Text | Description                                                                      |
| :--: | :----------                                                                      |
| `0`  | One stereo stem for the entire kit.<br>This should be used for no stem, as well. |
| `1`  | Mono kick, mono snare, stereo other.                                             |
| `2`  | Mono kick, stereo snare, stereo other.                                           |
| `3`  | Stereo kick, snare, and other.                                                   |
| `4`  | Mono kick, stereo other.                                                         |
| `5`  | Stereo kick, snare, toms, and cymbals.<br>Not part of the RBN docs, rather it is [defined as a community standard](https://strikeline.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issue/CH-43) based on the GH stem layout. |

- `flag` is an optional string added to the end of the event that applies a modification outside of setting up the mix:

| Text         | Description |
| :--:         | :---------- |
| `d`          | Known as Disco Flip.<br>- On non-Pro, swaps the the snare and other/cymbal+tom stems, such that snare is activated by yellow, and other/cymbal+tom are activated by red.<br>- On Pro Drums, flips yellow cymbal/yellow tom and red notes to restore proper playing of the part with cymbals instead of swapping the stems.<br>- This flag is used in sections that require alternating the left and right hands quickly on the hi-hat (commonly a disco beat, hence the name), which are typically charted swapped, since playing it un-swapped in non-Pro on stock Rock Band kits tends to be uncomfortable. |
| `dnoflip`    | Swaps the snare and kit/cymbal and tom stems on both non-Pro and Pro Drums, without swapping red and yellow in Pro Drums.<br>- Used in sections where notes should not be flipped in Pro Drums, but the snare and kit/cymbal stems should still be swapped.
| `easy`       | Unmutes the tom and cymbal stems on Easy.<br>- Used in sections where there are no tom or cymbal notes to unmute the kit stem or tom/cymbal stems. |
| `easynokick` | Unmutes the other/cymbal+tom stem on Easy.<br>- Used in sections where there are no kick notes to unmute the kick stem. |

Aside from `d` and `dnoflip`, detecting stem configuration can be done automatically and these mix events can be ignored if that approach is chosen. If these events are used for more than just disco flip in a chart, then the `configuration` number should remain constant throughout the chart.

#### Drums Track Type Determining

The Drums track doesn't have any way of specifying which kind of drums track it is from within the track itself, its type must be determined manually. The same goes for .chart files.

The type can be determined using a process such as the following:

- Check if an accompanying song.ini has either the `pro_drums` or `five_lane_drums` tags. If it does, then force the drums track to be parsed as if it were that type.
- If there is no song.ini, or if the tags to force a type do not exist, check the chart for 5-lane green (type 5) and cymbal markers (types 66, 67, and 68).
- If both 5-lane and Pro are detected, it may be preferable to prioritize Pro over 5-lane.

Additionally, if you wish to convert 5-lane to 4-lane Pro, or vice versa, here are some suggested conversions:

- 5-lane to 4-lane Pro:

| 5-lane | 4-lane Pro    |
| :----- | :---------    |
| Red    | Red           |
| Yellow | Yellow cymbal |
| Blue   | Blue tom      |
| Orange | Green cymbal  |
| Green  | Green tom     |
| O + G  | G cym + B tom |

- 4-lane Pro to 5-lane:

| 4-lane Pro    | 5-lane |
| :---------    | :----- |
| Red           | Red    |
| Yellow cymbal | Yellow |
| Yellow tom    | Blue   |
| Blue cymbal   | Orange |
| Blue tom      | Blue   |
| Green cymbal  | Orange |
| Green tom     | Green  |
| Y tom + B tom | R + B  |
| B cym + G cym | Y + O  |

#### Vocals Lyrics

Lyrics are stored as meta events (usually text or lyric), paired up with notes in the 36 to 84 range. Lyric phrases are marked using either note 105 or note 106, or both at the same time (same start and end).

There are various symbols used for specific things in lyrics:

| Name           | Symbol | Description                                                                             |
| :---           | :----: | :----------                                                                             |
| Hyphens        | `-`    | Joins this syllable with the next.                                                      |
| Pluses         | `+`    | Connects the previous note and the current note into a slide. Usually found standalone. |
| Equals         | `=`    | Replaced with a literal hyphen, and joins to the next syllable if placed at the end.    |
| Pounds         | `#`    | Marks a note as non-pitched.                                                            |
| Carets         | `^`    | Marks a note as non-pitched with a more lenient scoring.<br>Typically used on short syllables or syllables without sharp attacks. |
| Asterisks      | `*`    | Marks a note as non-pitched. Its difference is unknown.                                 |
| Percents       | `%`    | Marks a range division for vocals parts with large octave ranges.                       |
| Sections       | `§`    | Replaced by a tie character `‿` that indicates that two syllables are sung as a single syllable. Both syllables are in the same event, with the `§` used in place of a space between the two. |
| Dollars        | `$`    | Marks syllables in harmony parts as hidden.<br>In one case these are also on the standard Vocals track for some reason, its purpose is not known (may be a charting error). |
| Slashes        | `/`    | Unknown. These appear in some Rock Band charts, mainly The Beatles: Rock Band.          |
| Underscores    | `_`    | Replaced by a space.                                                                    |
| Angle brackets | `<>`   | Holds a text formatting tag.<br>Some games may support text formatting tags in lyrics (mainly Unity games). Other games that don't use these tags need to strip them out. |

Syllables not joined together through any symbols should be separated by a space during parsing.

Here's how these symbols should be handled for displaying as just text:

- Strip out `-`, `+`, `#`, `^`, `*`, `%`, `$`, `/`, `<>`, and anything between `<>`.
- Replace `=` with a hyphen `-`. Make sure to not strip out hyphens added as replacement for equals.
- Replace `§`, `_` with a space.
- Join together a syllable that has `-` or `=` at the end of it with the following syllable.

NOTE: Some charts may have more than one lyric event at the same position. While this shouldn't be common, it has happened in some charts and needs to be accounted for in some way.

Additional info:

- For RB3, up to 4 notes are allowed at a time, and extended sustains/disjoint chords are allowed.
- Trill and glissando lanes are used to make imprecise/indiscernible trills and glissandi easier to play. They prevent overhitting, and for trill markers, only require you to alternate faster than a certain threshold to hit the charted notes.
- The range shift notes will shift the range of the keys shown on the track. In RB3, 17 keys out of the 25 keys are shown at a time, so if there are notes that go beyond the current range, the range must be shifted to show those notes.
  - These notes do not last the duration of the shift, they simply mark when the shift happens.
  - One of these shifts should be marked at the very beginning as the starting range.

Additional info:

- The fret number of notes and markers that use fret numbers is determined by the MIDI note velocity, starting from velocity 100 and going to velocity 117 for 17-fret or 122 for 22-fret.
- There are separate tracks for 17-fret and 22-fret due to different controller models having a different amount of available frets.
- Root notes are required for chords, but they don't have to be placed on every chord. It's only necessary to place one when the root note changes.
- RB3 slide direction rules:
  - If the sustain ends within a 1/16th of a following note, the slide will follow the direction of the next note's fret number: lower to higher will slide up, higher to lower will slide down. If both are the same, it will slide down.
  - Otherwise, if the fret number for the corresponding note is 0-7, the slide will go up, otherwise if it's 8 or higher it will go down.
  - For chords, the lowest non-open (fret number of 0) string's fret number determines the direction.
  - At least for muted notes or muted chords, the direction can be reversed by placing the slide marker on channel 12.
- For RB3, overdrive must match that of standard Guitar/Bass.
