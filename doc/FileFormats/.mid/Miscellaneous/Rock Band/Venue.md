# Rock Band Venue Track

This track controls camera placement/effects and venue lighting/effects in Rock Band.

Rock Band Network 1 and Rock Band Network 2 have different sets of venue notes and events, so categories are split into RB1/RB2/RBN1 and RB3/RBN2.

| 37        | Spotlight on bass                           |

The camera cut notes are always placed at the same time. The random camera shot note works with the notes above it to narrow down the number of possibilities for that cut.

Spotlight and sing-alongs last for the duration of their notes.

Lighting keyframes take effect instantaneously, and their length does not matter.

Post-processing events only take effect at camera cuts. The length of the note determines how long the effect will take to transition in; if the note is 1/16th or less in length, then it will take effect immediately with no transition.

## Text Events

### RB1, RB2, RBN1

#### Directed Camera Cuts

Directed cuts are special camera cuts which use animations that don't appear in the standard looping animations for basic camera cuts. These have a variable amount of pre-roll, so the event is placed where the "hit" of the animation goes: for example, if the guitarist should jump or kick the camera, the event should be placed at the time the guitarist should land, or when the kick hits the camera.

There are two ways to call a directed cut:

| Event Text                | Description                                    |
| :---------                | :----------                                    |
| `[do_directed_cut <cut>]` | Always play the cut.                           |
| `[do_optional_cut <cut>]` | Only play the cut if the player is doing well. |

`cut` is the cut to be called:

#### Other

These events trigger an explosion effect or flamethrowers on the venue. These only work in arena venues, and should not be used during a BRE, as they trigger this automatically.

These toggle fog on stage:

#### Camera Cuts

These text events specify a camera shot to be used. In Rock Band 3, only 4 band members can be on-stage at a time out of the 5 possible instrument types, so camera cuts are often stacked on the same point to ensure a proper shot is used. The camera system has a priority list it uses to pick a shot that most closely matches the characters on-stage. If none of the authored cuts match the available parts, it will pick from a list of generic parts.

Available cuts:

(These don't all have specific descriptions for what exactly they do, so descriptions may be extrapolated from the name.)

- One-character cuts:

#### Directed Camera Cuts

Directed cuts are special camera cuts which have a higher priority over standard cuts and use animations that don't appear in the standard looping animations for basic camera cuts. These are placed where the "hit" of the animation goes: for example, if the guitarist should jump or kick the camera, the event should be placed at the time the guitarist should land, or when the kick hits the camera.

Available cuts:

(As with standard cuts, these don't all have specific descriptions for what exactly they do, so descriptions may be extrapolated from the name.)
