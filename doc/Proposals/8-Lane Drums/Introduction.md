# 8-Lane Drums

8-lane drums is a proposed new format for drum charting that aims to be more robust and capable than the current 4-lane Pro layout is.

It introduces a number of new features:

- Complete separation of drum and cymbal lanes.
- An additional cymbal lane.
- Hi-hat pedal marking.

It also streamlines some existing features:

- Disco flip is now handled by flipping the notes only in 4-lane standard, the notes in the chart file itself no longer need to be flipped manually and subsequently unflipped during Pro/8-lane gameplay.
- Any two lanes can be swapped with disco flipping, not just red and yellow.
- Roll lanes can now be placed per lane. (To be reviewed)
- Various other format cleanups, such as Star Power/Overdrive activation phrases now only using a single note.

In addition to these, it maintains compatibility with 4-lane Pro/standard with automatic conversions, and includes the ability to specify what 4-lane lane an 8-lane note gets placed on.
